DEPLOY STEPS (GitHub -> Vercel)

1) Create a new GitHub repository (public or private) and push the contents of this ZIP to the repo root.
   - Ensure package.json, vite.config.js, index.html, and src/ are in the repo root (not nested in a folder).

2) In Vercel dashboard, click 'New Project' -> 'Import Git Repository' -> connect your GitHub and choose the repo.
   - Framework Preset: Vite
   - Build Command: npm run build
   - Output Directory: dist
   - Install Command: npm install

3) Set Environment Variables in Vercel (Project Settings -> Environment Variables):
   - OPENAI_API_KEY = (your OpenAI key)
   - SUPPORT_EMAIL = rcnsuporte048@gmail.com

4) Deploy. Vercel will run npm install and npm run build and publish the site.

5) If you prefer Upload method: In Vercel -> New Project -> Upload Project (choose this ZIP). Then set build/output as above.

Notes:
- Do NOT commit secret keys to GitHub. Use Vercel env vars for OPENAI_API_KEY.
- If you embedded keys locally for testing, remove them before committing.
